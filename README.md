# Raspberry Pi Midi Audio Controler, driving rotary-encoders, I2C digital potentiometers (digipots), 24xLEDs-bargraphs used as real time true VU-Meters and Digipots position display, I2C LCD for displaying values and menues, and few dry loops as I/O controls.

Writed in pure ANSI C language.

This could be the logic pilot for any analog audio project, DSP, Music Instrument, preamp, amp, effect box, when you must drive the internal value with I2C digipots and display any information or value in an I2C alphanumeric LCD display and/or an or further I2C LEDs bargraph. Excellent to upgrade an old analog only preamp or amplifier which have no memory or remote possibility, or add a Midi pedalboard when not possible.

This project will grow in features (WEB GUI, recorded prefered values, Midi Interface, API set for remote control, etc...) depending my available time and my pleasure as hobbyist.

This work is for my Electric Guitar Valves Preamp project initiated 3 years ago. It will drive all the features of my preamp.

You can contact me for any discussion or help regarding this project at F6HQZ@hamwlan.net

Have fun adn ggod music !
