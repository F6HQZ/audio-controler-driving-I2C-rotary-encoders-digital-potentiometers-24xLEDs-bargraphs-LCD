# Raspberry Pi Midi audio-controler-driving-rotary-encoders- I2C-digital-potentiometers-24xLEDs-bargraphs-LCD
audio controler driving rotary encoders,  I2C digital potentiometers,  I2C 24xLEDs bargraphs,  I2C LCD, for Raspberry PI, writed in C language.
This could be the logic pilot for any analog audio project, DSP, Music Instrument, preamp, amp, effect box, when you must drive the internal value with I2C digipots and display any information or value in an I2C alphanumeric LCD display and/or an or further I2C LEDs bargraph. Excellent to upgrade an old analog only preamp or amplifier which have no memory or remote possibility, or add a Midi pedalboard when not possible.
This project will grow in features (WEB GUI, recorded prefered values, Midi Interface, API set for remote control, etc...) depending my available time and my pleasure as hobbyist.
This work is for my Electric Guitar Valves Preamp project initiated 3 years ago. It will drive all the features of my preamp.
